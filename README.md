## Dat and Python Integration

This is a rough list of what a Dat integrated into Python would look like. 

* [Pandas I/O API](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html)

* [Integration with Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/docs/latest/index.html)

* [Dat and Ipython](http://ipython.org/)

Looking to make using Dat and Python seamless as possible for developers. If you have any suggestions or any use cases for Dat and Python, please comment.
